# ethminer

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

> Ethereum miner with OpenCL, CUDA and stratum support. Cloned from ethrereum-mining/ethminer.

This is adapted for personal use and make no claims of viability.

## Usage

The **ethminer** is a command line program. This means you launch it either
from a Windows command prompt or Linux console, or create shortcuts to
predefined command lines using a Linux Bash script or Windows batch/cmd file.
For a full list of available command, please run

```sh

### Building from source

This project uses [CMake] and [Hunter] package manager.

1. Make sure git submodules are up to date

   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. Create a build directory.

   ```sh
   mkdir build; cd build
   ```

3. Configure the project with CMake. Check out additional
   [configuration options](#cmake-configuration-options).

   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project using [CMake Build Tool Mode]. This is a portable variant
   of `make`.

   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```

   Note: In Windows, it is possible to have compiler issues if you don't specify build config. In that case use:

   ```sh
   cmake --build . --config Release
   ```

5. _(Optional, Linux only)_ Install the built executable.

   ```sh
   sudo make install
   ```

### CMake configuration options

Pass these options to CMake configuration command, e.g.

```sh
cmake .. -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DETHASHCL=OFF
```

- `-DETHASHCL=ON` - enable OpenCL mining, `ON` by default,
- `-DETHASHCUDA=ON` - enable CUDA mining, `OFF` by default.
